# Advent of Code 2025 🎄

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) challenges.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
.
├── day01/          # Day 1 solutions
├── day02/          # Day 2 solutions
├── day03/          # Day 3 solutions
...
├── day25/          # Day 25 solutions
└── README.md       # This file
```

Each day's folder contains:
- `solution.py`, `solution.js`, `solution.go`, etc. - Solution code in various languages
- `input.txt` - Puzzle input (optional, can be kept private)
- `README.md` - Problem description and notes
- `test_input.txt` - Example input from the problem statement

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Depending on the language used for each solution, you may need:
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- Go 1.19+
- Java 11+
- Or any other language of choice

### Running Solutions

Each day's solution can be run independently. Navigate to the specific day's folder and follow the instructions in that day's README.

Example for Python:
```bash
cd day01
python solution.py
```

Example for JavaScript:
```bash
cd day01
node solution.js
```

## 📊 Progress
